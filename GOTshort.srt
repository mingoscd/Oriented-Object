== sync, corrected by elderman ==

3
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,937
Look at me.
Look at me!

4
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:13,140
Do you remember
me now, boy, eh?

5
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,909
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

6
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,579
You'll be coming
with me, boy,

7
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:22,615
and you'll be keeping
your mouth shut.

8
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:42,067
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

9
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:45,237
You're not a <i>smart</i> boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

10
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,007
Do you want
to live, boy?!

11
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,013
North, boy,
we're going north.

12
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:28,382
It had three eyes.

13
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,118
It told me to come
with him, so I did.

14
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:34,887
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

15
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:37,757
Your father's not
down there, little lord.

16
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,059
Not for many years yet.

17
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:44,429
You're afraid--
just like Hodor.

18
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:46,598
I'm not afraid of some hole
in the ground.

19
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,869
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

20
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:53,039
I'm a crippled boy
and I'm willing to go.

21
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:01,179
That's my grandfather
Lord Rickard.

22
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:04,516
He was burned alive
by the Mad King Aerys.

23
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,954
That's Lyanna,
my father's sister.

24
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:10,890
<i>King Robert was</i>
<i>supposed to marry her,</i>

25
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,994
<i>but Rhaegar Targaryen</i>
<i>kidnapped her.</i>

26
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:16,496
<i>Robert started a war</i>
<i>to win her back.</i>

27
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,700
<i>He killed Rhaegar,</i>
<i>but she died anyway.</i>

28
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,270
That's where
I saw father.

29
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:28,140
You see?
He's not here.

30
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,784
-<i>Here, Shaggydog.</i>
-Rickon!

31
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,719
That beast

32
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,155
is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

33
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,392
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

34
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,762
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see father.

35
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:52,431
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing

36
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,634
with Sansa and Arya.

37
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:57,070
He was down here.
I saw him.

38
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,838
Saw him when?

39
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,673
<i>Last night,</i>

40
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,342
when I was sleeping.

41
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:05,877
Here, Shaggydog.

42
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,750
You both miss him.

43
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:15,786
It's only natural
he should be in your thoughts

44
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:19,623
and dreams,
but that doesn't mean that--

45
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:22,427
Bran...

46
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:41,915
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

47
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,750
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

48
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:46,252
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

49
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:49,388
My Lady.

50
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,671
Robb.

51
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,941
Robb.

52
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,880
<i>Robb!</i>

53
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:54,253
You've ruined your sword.

54
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:06,165
Shh shh.

55
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,934
- Shh.
- I'll kill them all--

56
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:12,471
--Every one of them.

57
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,741
I will kill them all.

58
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,146
My boy.

59
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,716
They have your sisters.

60
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:28,053
We have to get
the girls back.

61
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:32,825
And then we will
kill them all.

00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:47,370
Isn't it a funny song?

77
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:50,473
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your rendition.</i>

78
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,475
I imagine it was even better
received at that tavern.

79
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,544
I'm so sorry,
Your Grace.

80
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,545
I'll never sing it again,
I swear.

81
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,714
Tell me,
which do you favor:

82
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,450
<i>Your fingers</i>
<i>or your tongue?</i>

83
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:04,152
Your Grace?

84
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,088
Fingers
or your tongue?

85
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:09,258
If you got to keep one,
which would it be?

86
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,961
I-- I--

87
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:14,230
or I could just
cut your throat.

88
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,067
Every man needs hands,
Your Grace.

89
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:19,669
Good.

90
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:22,538
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

91
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,640
I won't sing--
Your Grace.

92
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,809
Ser Ilyn,
who better than you

93
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:28,945
- to carry out the sentence?
- I beg you!

94
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,480
Please no.

95
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:33,883
<i>No!</i>

96
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:39,021
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

97
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,957
- I'm done for the day.
- <i>No-oooo!</i>

98
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:43,603
I'll leave the rest
of the matters to you, mother.

99
00:09:46,932 --> 00:09:49,433
Your Grace, please!

100
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,710
You look quite nice.

101
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,479
Thank you, My Lord.

102
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,981
"Your Grace."
I'm King now.

103
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:06,418
<i>Stop-ppp!</i>
<i>No!</i>

104
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:09,220
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

105
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,327
Do as you're bid, child.

106
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,603
...And as soon as you've had
your blood, I'll put a son in you.

107
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,407
Mother says that
shouldn't be long.

108
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,580
No, please no!

109
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,448
This one's your father.

110
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,685
This one here.

111
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,154
Look at it and see
what happens to traitors.

112
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:46,191
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

113
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,494
I gave him
a clean death.

114
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,196
Look at him.

115
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,532
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear.

116
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:58,102
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here

117
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,805
and obey.

118
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,140
Look at him!

119
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:13,385
<i>Well?</i>

120
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:16,322
How long
do I have to look?

121
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,560
As long as it pleases me.

122
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,698
Do you want
to see the rest?

123
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,967
If it please Your Grace.

124
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,303
That's your Septa there.

125
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,606
<i>I'll tell you what:</i>

126
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,975
I'm going to give you
a present.

127
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,779
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

128
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,281
I'm going to give you
his head as well.

129
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:44,017
Or maybe he'll
give me yours.
